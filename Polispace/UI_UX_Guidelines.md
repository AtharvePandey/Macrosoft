# UI/UX Design and Style Guidelines for PoliSpace

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the UI/UX guidelines for PoliSpace, ensuring a standardized, accessible, and visually appealing user experience.

## 2. Color Scheme
- **Primary Color:** #ec3f5b (Red) – Main color / theme of polispace, ever present in the navbar and non-theme pages and the color theme for local feed to emphasize local engagement. 
- **Secondary Colors:**
  - **Blue Shades:** #6A5ACD (State tab) and #1E3A8A (Federal tab) – Used for navigation and visual distinction between feeds.
  - **Gray:** #F5F5F5 – Background for a clean, neutral appearance.

## 3. Typography
- **Primary Font:** Sans-serif (e.g., Roboto) for readability.
- **Font Sizes:**
  - Header (App Name): 24px, bold
  - Section Titles: 18px, bold
  - Body Text: 16px, regular
  - Small Labels: 14px

## 4. Layout & Spacing
- **Navigation Tabs:** Clearly separated Local, State, and Federal sections with distinct colors.
- **Card-Based Content Display:** Posts appear in bordered boxes with padding (16px) and spacing (24px between elements).

## 5. Component Behavior
- **Feed Tabs:**
  - Active tab: Bold text with a highlight bar.
  - Inactive tabs: Dimmed background color.
- **Hover Effects:**
  - Buttons, tabs, and text input boxes should slightly darken on hover.
  - Links underline on hover.
- **Interactive Elements:**
  - Comment sections have alternate background shading to the main post for readability.

## 6. Accessibility Standards
- **Contrast Ratio:** Minimum 4.5:1 for text and UI elements.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tabs and feed should be navigable via arrow keys.
- **Text Alternatives:** Any non-text item within a post or comment should be able to have a text-alternative.
- **Non-Color Coding:** Functionality should never be interpreted based solely on color. At a minimum, there should be accompanying text, icons, or patterns to differentiate interactive elements. For example, error messages should include an icon and text instead of just a red border.

## 7. Responsive Design Considerations
- **Mobile View:**
  - TBD
- **Tablet/Desktop View:**
  - Grid-based layout with flexible card widths.
  - Main content area adapts to available space.

## 8. Storage & Collaboration
This document is stored within the Poispace app folder (i.e, https://github.com/AtharvePandey/Macrosoft/tree/main/Polispace) and will be updated as needed.
