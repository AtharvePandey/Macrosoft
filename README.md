## Overview  
**Polispace** is a platform designed to bridge the gap between legislation and public discourse. It allows users to track bills and policies at various levels of government—local, state, and federal—while engaging in discussions through comments and reactions. By fostering transparency and civic engagement, Polispace empowers individuals to stay informed and make their voices heard on policies that shape their communities.
